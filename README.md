# BlueSnowThreshold

 
 This code is designed to run on PlanetScope Analytic Surface Reflectance Imagery (SR) which is a reflectance product scaled by 10,000.
 This means the range of the pixel values is 0-10,000 rather than 0-1, which is typical of other SR products. 
 The 10000 scaling factor is worked into this code as a default for a function argument.
